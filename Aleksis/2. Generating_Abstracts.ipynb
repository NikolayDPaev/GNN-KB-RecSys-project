Starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Edward James Olmos, it is an adaptation of Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? The film is set in a dystopian future Los Angeles of 2019, in which synthetic humans known as replicants are bio-engineered by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work on space colonies. When a fugitive group of advanced replicants led by Roy Batty (Hauer) escapes back to Earth, burnt-out cop Rick Deckard (Ford) reluctantly agrees to hunt them down. Blade Runner initially underperformed in North American theaters and polarized critics; some praised its thematic complexity and visuals, while others critiqued its slow pacing and lack of action. It later became a cult film, and has since come to be regarded as one of the all-time best science fiction films. Hailed for its production design depicting a high-tech but decaying future, Blade Runner is often regarded as both a leading example of neo-noir cinema as well as a foundational work of the cyberpunk genre. The film's soundtrack, composed by Vangelis, was nominated in 1982 for a BAFTA and a Golden Globe as best original score. The film has influenced many science fiction films, video games, anime, and television series. It brought the work of Philip K. Dick to the attention of Hollywood, and several of his works later became films such as Total Recall (1990), Minority Report (2002), and A Scanner Darkly (2006). In 1993, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Seven different versions of Blade Runner exist as a result of controversial changes requested by studio executives. A director's cut was released in 1992 after a strong response to test screenings of a workprint. This, in conjunction with the film's popularity as a video rental, made it one of the earliest movies to be released on DVD. In 2007, Warner Bros. released The Final Cut, a 25th-anniversary digitally remastered version. This is the only version over which Scott retained artistic control. The film is the first of the franchise of the same name. A sequel, directed by Denis Villeneuve and titled Blade Runner 2049, was released in October 2017 alongside a trilogy of short films covering the thirty-year span between the two films' settings. The anime series Blade Runner: Black Lotus was released in 2021.\n"]}],"source":["from rdflib import Graph, URIRef, RDF\n","# from rdflib.namespace import dbo\n","uri = URIRef('http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blade_Runner')\n","\n","g = Graph()\n","g.parse(uri)\n","\n","query_en = \"\"\"\n","PREFIX dbo:<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n","SELECT ?abstract\n","WHERE {\n","    ?a dbo:abstract ?abstract .\n","    FILTER (lang(?abstract) = 'en')\n","}\"\"\"\n","query = \"\"\"\n","PREFIX dbo:<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n","SELECT ?abstract\n","WHERE {\n","    ?a dbo:abstract ?abstract .\n","}\"\"\"\n","\n","qres = g.query(query_en)\n","for row in qres:\n","    print(f\"{row.abstract}\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"BRgtgtI6p78l","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":5,"status":"ok","timestamp":1716106182321,"user":{"displayName":"Aleksis Datseris","userId":"08655277826660057848"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"BRgtgtI6p78l","outputId":"d581dda8-02dc-45d2-e6b7-88eb0ae50cd0"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["ext\n"]},{"data":{"text/plain":["5"]},"execution_count":12,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["try:\n","    uri = 5\n","    raise Exception(\"ext\")\n","except Exception as err:\n","    print(err)\n","uri"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"lLPoSF3f376x","metadata":{"id":"lLPoSF3f376x"},"outputs":[],"source":["bad_requests = []"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"r8K0Ch_9cPDy","metadata":{"id":"r8K0Ch_9cPDy"},"outputs":[],"source":["def get_abstracts(nodes):\n","    abstracts = []\n","    abstracts_count = 0\n","\n","    for node in nodes:\n","        try:\n","            uri = URIRef(node)\n","            g = Graph()\n","            g.parse(uri)\n","            qres = g.query(query_en)\n","        except Exception as err:\n","            bad_requests.append(node)\n","            print(err)\n","            print(node)\n","            continue\n","\n","        if len(qres) < 1:\n","            qres = g.query(query)\n","        for row in qres:\n","            abstracts.append(row.abstract)\n","            abstracts_count += 1\n","\n","    return abstracts, abstracts_count\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"J0s5AIuadKMV","metadata":{"id":"J0s5AIuadKMV"},"outputs":[],"source":["meta_data = {\n","        'abstracts' : [],\n","        'abstracts_count' : [],\n","}"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"hjdI4pgudirG","metadata":{"id":"hjdI4pgudirG"},"outputs":[],"source":["# meta_data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"uG73FckuCaYj","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":9954035,"status":"ok","timestamp":1716125421013,"user":{"displayName":"Aleksis Datseris","userId":"08655277826660057848"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"uG73FckuCaYj","outputId":"86ae6582-eb14-4b8d-edb7-bf2bebad0efe"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["0 0 0\n","100 67 13\n","200 134 17\n","HTTP Error 400: Bad Request\n","http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_&_Viv\n","300 206 27\n","400 272 34\n","500 337 38\n","HTTP Error 400: Bad Request\n","http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cats_&_Dogs\n","HTTP Error 400: Bad Request\n","http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oliver_&_Company\n","600 417 55\n","700 481 60\n","HTTP Error 400: Bad Request\n","http://dbpedia.org/resource/Secrets_&_Lies_(film)\n","800 551 67\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["WARNING:rdflib.term:http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatAlbumsProducedByRobertJohn\"Mutt\"Lange does not look like a valid URI, trying to serialize this will break.\n","WARNING:rdflib.term:Failed to convert Literal lexical form to value.

He would work with B\\u00e9art again on his final feature, 1995's Nelly and Mr. Arnaud (original title Nelly et Monsieur Arnaud).\",\n          \"Paradise Lost is an epic poem in blank verse by the 17th-century English poet John Milton (1608\\u20131674). The first version, published in 1667, consists of ten books with over ten thousand lines of verse. A second edition followed in 1674, arranged into twelve books (in the manner of Virgil's Aeneid) with minor revisions throughout. It is considered to be Milton's masterpiece, and it helped solidify his reputation as one of the greatest English poets of all time. The poem concerns the biblical story of the Fall of Man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.<sep>Purgatory (Latin: purgatorium, borrowed into English via Anglo-Norman and Old French) is, according to the belief of some Christian denominations (mostly Catholic), an intermediate state after physical death for expiatory purification. The process of purgatory is the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. Tradition, by reference to certain texts of scripture, sees the process as involving a cleansing fire. Some forms of Western Christianity, particularly within Protestantism, deny its existence. Other strands of Western Christianity see purgatory as a place, perhaps filled with fire. Some concepts of Gehenna in Judaism resemble those of purgatory. The word \\\"purgatory\\\" has come to refer to a wide range of historical and modern conceptions of postmortem suffering short of everlasting damnation. English-speakers also use the word in a non-specific sense to mean any place or condition of suffering or torment, especially one that is temporary. According to Jacques Le Goff, the conception of purgatory as a physical place came into existence in Western Europe toward the end of the twelfth century. Le Goff states that the concept involves the idea of a purgatorial fire, which he suggests \\\"is expiatory and purifying not punitive like hell fire\\\". At the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, when the Catholic Church defined, for the first time, its teaching on purgatory, the Eastern Orthodox Church did not adopt the doctrine. The council made no mention of purgatory as a third place or as containing fire, which are absent also in the declarations by the Councils of Florence (1431-1449) and of Trent (1545-1563). Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI have declared that the term does not indicate a place, but a condition of existence. The Church of England, mother church of the Anglican Communion, officially denounces what it calls \\\"the Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory\\\", but the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches, and elements of the Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist traditions hold that for some there is cleansing after death and pray for the dead. The Reformed Churches teach that the departed are delivered from their sins through the process of glorification. Rabbinical Judaism also believes in the possibility of after-death purification and may even use the word \\\"purgatory\\\" to describe the similar rabbinical concept of Gehenna, though Gehenna is also sometimes described as more similar to hell or Hades.\",\n          \"No Small Affair is a 1984 American comedy-drama film directed by Jerry Schatzberg and starring Jon Cryer and Demi Moore.

The Reformed Churches teach that the departed are delivered from their sins through the process of glorification.

It was chosen to compete at the 49th Venice International Film Festival, where it won four awards, including tying for the Silver Lion. It was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 1994 BAFTA awards. The romantic drama was the second-to-last film made by French writer/director Claude Sautet.

The first version, published in 1667, consists of ten books with over ten thousand lines of verse. A second edition followed in 1674, arranged into twelve books (in the manner of Virgil's Aeneid) with minor revisions throughout. It is considered to be Milton's masterpiece, and it helped solidify his reputation as one of the greatest English poets of all time. The poem concerns the biblical story of the Fall of Man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.<sep>Purgatory (Latin: purgatorium, borrowed into English via Anglo-Norman and Old French) is, according to the belief of some Christian denominations (mostly Catholic), an intermediate state after physical death for expiatory purification. The process of purgatory is the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. Tradition, by reference to certain texts of scripture, sees the process as involving a cleansing fire. Some forms of Western Christianity, particularly within Protestantism, deny its existence. Other strands of Western Christianity see purgatory as a place, perhaps filled with fire. Some concepts of Gehenna in Judaism resemble those of purgatory. The word \\\"purgatory\\\" has come to refer to a wide range of historical and modern conceptions of postmortem suffering short of everlasting damnation. English-speakers also use the word in a non-specific sense to mean any place or condition of suffering or torment, especially one that is temporary. According to Jacques Le Goff, the conception of purgatory as a physical place came into existence in Western Europe toward the end of the twelfth century. Le Goff states that the concept involves the idea of a purgatorial fire, which he suggests \\\"is expiatory and purifying not punitive like hell fire\\\". At the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, when the Catholic Church defined, for the first time, its teaching on purgatory, the Eastern Orthodox Church did not adopt the doctrine. The council made no mention of purgatory as a third place or as containing fire, which are absent also in the declarations by the Councils of Florence (1431-1449) and of Trent (1545-1563). Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI have declared that the term does not indicate a place, but a condition of existence. The Church of England, mother church of the Anglican Communion, officially denounces what it calls \\\"the Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory\\\", but the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches, and elements of the Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist traditions hold that for some there is cleansing after death and pray for the dead. The Reformed Churches teach that the departed are delivered from their sins through the process of glorification. Rabbinical Judaism also believes in the possibility of after-death purification and may even use the word \\\"purgatory\\\" to describe the similar rabbinical concept of Gehenna, though Gehenna is also sometimes described as more similar to hell or Hades.\",\n          \"No Small Affair is a 1984 American comedy-drama film directed by Jerry Schatzberg and starring Jon Cryer and Demi Moore.
